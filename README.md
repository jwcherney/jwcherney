  Human nature with respect to new technologies:
  - If you got it when you were under 20, its taken for granted
  - if you got it when you were between 20 and 40, its a wonderful thing that makes life better
  - If you got it when you were over 40, its an abomination and you remember fondly the times before it came along
  
  That doesn't always have to be the case, though. Remember, it is all in your perspective, and in your attitude.
